// Dude, Where's My Car: a Tesla in the bar, and a map behind it.
//
// The bar shows the Tesla mark and, while the car is moving, how fast. The
// panel shows where it is, which way it is pointing, how full it is and how
// far that gets you.
//
// The interesting constraint is not the drawing, it is the asking. Tesla's
// API has calls that are answered by Tesla's servers and calls that are
// answered by the car, and the second kind resets the car's sleep timer. A
// widget that refreshed itself every few seconds would quietly stop the car
// ever sleeping and flatten the battery over a week of standing still.
//
// So the bar polls only the free call, online, asleep or offline, and the
// car itself is asked at three moments: when you open the panel, while it is
// driving (awake regardless of us) and while it is charging (likewise). A
// parked car is left alone. `bin/tesla` enforces that a second
// time from the other side, so a mistake in this file cannot flatten anything.
//
// Glyphs are \u escapes rather than literal characters, so the source survives
// editors and patches that mangle private-use codepoints.
